# Ignite Sessions

## Glenn Sarti - Sharing: What's in it for me?
 * "Without sharing, there is no DevOps".
 * Rubber ducking: talk through a complex problem with a rubber duck, then a miracle occurs and a solution to your problem appears.
   - Works by slowing your brain down enough to actually break down a complex problem.
 * What about writing? Helps you:
   1. Find your voice.
   2. Re-affirming values.
   3. Sharing your story.
   4. Building resilience.

## Adam Lefkowitz - Automate all the things - including your brain
 **SKIPPED**

## Soo Choi - Why Are You So Angry? Or how I stopped worrying and love public speaking
 **SKIPPED**

## Ed Anderson - I AM DEVOPS AND I LIKE FUNCTIONS
 * Serverless (aka. functions as a service).
 * All administration is done via functions rather than a system admin box.
 * Barriers:
   1. KISS (Keep It Simple and Short).
   2. Know your cloud.
   3. Know the marginal cost of AWS.
   4. Bumpy cloud code smells.
 * As long as you understand how the cloud works, it _is_ cheaper to do things in the cloud.
 * Benefits:
   1. Cost savings.
   2. Event based triggers.
   3. Cloud ControlPlane Magic.
 * Tips:
   - Ship Cloud and Code together.
   - Functions are _not_ magic,

## Ken Mugrage - You Can't Buy DevOps, But You May Need To Sell It.
 * "We basically sell a tool that gives you DevOps."
 * They've herd this all before.
 * There are two reasons people do change.
   1. The carrot.
   2. The stick.
 * You _will_ have security issues.
 * Making all these points won't convince people to change.
 * Top down change doesn't work.
 * But there are patterns! Geeks love patterns!
 * Tips:
   1. Tailor your message for your audience.
   2. Lunch and learn. (Have a good agenda)
   3. Leave hints.
   4. Find innovators
   5. Ask for help, and say thank you!
   6. Mentor teams.
