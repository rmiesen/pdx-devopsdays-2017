## Before we start

## The Question:

## When Am I the Crazy One
 * Alone in your Viewpoint.
 * Explanations Useless.
 * Solution is Obvious.

## Techniques of a Gaslighter
 * Outright denial.

   - Misunderstanding
   - Unreasonable
 * Taking offense/overreacting
 * Slowly pushing boundaries
 * "You're too ..."

## Solutions to Gaslighting
 * Three tiers of intervention.

### Tier 1: Ask Nicely
 * Validate Them:
   - "I hear that you're not doing this on purpose..."
   - "I know that you think I'm overreacting..."
 * State your feelings:
   - "This makes me feel uncomfortable anyways..."
   - "This is important to me..."
 * Ask for change:
   - Please stop.

### Tier 2: Setting boundaries, escalating up the Management chain
 * Set boundaries
   - What are you truly willing to do?
   - What won't you put up with?
   - What is the limit of your responsibility?
 * Communicate your boundaries to:
   1. The gaslighter
   2. Their manager.
   3. Your Manager.
   4. (If the first three don't drive results) HR.
 * Stick to your guns
   - Document _every_ infraction.

### Tier 3: Leave
 * If nobody will listen and not even HR will put a stop to the gaslighting, leave. Very little in life is worth the loss of self-trust.
