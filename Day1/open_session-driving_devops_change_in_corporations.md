# Driving DevOps change in a large Corporation:
 * Driving factors:
   - Customers demanding faster deployment.
   - Existing processes, teams resist change.
   - Infighting between Devs and Ops
   - Siloing
 * An intermediate step: create a "DevOps" team.
   - Still a silo
   - Still prone to infighting.
 * 
 
## Methods for driving change:
 * Find champions within the org.
   - Build a network of these champions.
 * Hire folks who believe in DevOps.
 * Encourage people to do things in a more "DevOps" manner.
 * "Don't try to boil the ocean." Drive incremental, gradual, small changes.
 * Convince those who are resistant to change how DevOps will benefit them, eliminate pain points.
 * Don't come in with an agenda: ask yourself "How can I make their lives easier and solve your problems?"
   - Don't use the word "DevOps": just solve their problem. Demonstrate the process.
 * Get management on-board with DevOps culture or it won't go anywhere.
