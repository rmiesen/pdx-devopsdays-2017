LAMA: Logging Alerting, Monitoring, Analytics


## Vision
 * engineers solving unknown problems.
 * Automation solving known prolems.

## TL;DR;
 * DevOps is the past
 * NoOps is the future
   - Full automation
   - Centralized IT depts writing code, adding value.
 * DevOps in a nutshell: "You build it, you run it."  --Werner Vogels, Amazon AWS CTO.

## Team Principles
 * Meet internal partners where they are.
 * Acts as a fluid team.
 * Engineering excellence.
 * Dogfooding
 * Enabling E2E (doh!)
 * Batteries Included: include everything needed to run the org from day one.
 * **Nothing is "somebody else's" problem!**

## Principles
 * The only source of truth is the code:
   - Infrastructure as code.
   - Configuration as code. (**WHAT? ISN'T THAT JUST IAC?**)
   - Alerts are codified.
   - Every commit in VCS.
   - Automated delivery architecutre.
   - SRE is a global sport.
 * Global teamwork:
   - ChatOps
   - Shared dashboards
   - Well-defined roles
   - Road shows + site visits
   - Community newsletters
   - Recorded trainings
   - Demos every two weeks.

## Toolchain
### Cloud services tools
 * Cloud, hybrid, and On-prem
 * New Relic (monitoring)
   - Real user Monitoring
     + Browser
     + Mobile
   - Performane Monitoring
     + APM
     + Infrastructure
     + Synthetics
 * Elastic Stack (ELK)
   - Logging

## Batteries Included - Your Starter Kit to Ops
 * Enabling Operational Maturity from Day 1
 * Combine Technical + ChatOps
 * Measuring Performance
   - Apdex (how satisfactory the response time of an app is), Disk, CPU/Load, Memory
 * PagerDuty.
 * Slack.

## Building a SRE Superhero
 * Perfect blend of experience.
 * Capacity to continue learning.
 * Lead without prompting.
 * Always 'ON' attitude.
 * Blended technical and communications strategy.
 * BE AVAILABLE.

## Typical SRE Bckground - Science + Service
 * Science or Information Systems Degree.
 * Passion for engineering excellent.
 * Knowledge of OOP: Python, Go.
 * Klowledge of Agile SDLC.
 * TCP/IP Netwoking and troubleshooting.
 * Basic SQL.
 * Be active: GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.

## Hiring in this New Paradigm
 * Simplify the job description for diversity inclusion.
 * Juggling the Science versus the service.
 * Three background profiles:
   - Engineer
   - Operations
   - SDET/QA
 * It's not easy to implement.


## Leveling Up Strategy
 * Sharing and exchanging ideas.
 * Bring in learning from the field.
 * Wiki for the future.
 * Local meetups matter.
 * Conferences (duh!)
