# Adventures in Enterprise: Lessons Learned Promoting DevOps in a Legacy Organization
**Author:** Steve Desmond

## DevOps
 * Culture
 * Automation
 * Measurement
 * Sharing

## Enterprise
 * Software used to satisfy the needs of an organization rather than an individual.

## Legacy
 * on-premises data centers
 * Physical servers
 * Weekend downtime
 * Project Downtime.

## Part 1: Don't rock the boat
### Big Orgs move slow
 * A change can take up to two years to implement any sort of change.
 * Reasons:
   - Stability over innovation.
   - Control change vs embracing it.
   - Physical scaling limitations.
   - Project-centric planning.

### Software is not a Building: it's Organic
 * Don't build them in the same way.

### PL/SQL
 * Filesystem I/O
 * LDAP Management
 * HTTP connections

### Bringing about Change
 * Be Prepared for more Resistance than you can Imagine
 * Assume Awesomeness: <https://github.com/BeardedCoder/RealWorldProcesses>
 * Lead by Example: "Be the CAMS model!"
   - Automate everything
   - Measure changes
   - Lead
 * Don't rock the Boat (too much).
 * Team dynamics are Paramount.

## Part 2: celebrate your victories
 * Use small controlled Experiments.
 * Use continuous improvements.
 * Use CI processes.

### ChatOps
 * Can be used to automate all sorts of release processes and drive a CD model.

### Decouple from your Enterprise Systems
 * Enables developers to change more liberally.
 * Extend apps by configuration. Don't fork vendor code.
 * Look for Low-Hanging fruit.
 * Lead times:
   - ERB: 2 -- 7 days
   - Web: 5 -- 20 minutes

### Re-Org
 * Can undo everything.
 
## Part 3
 * You (as an individual) can't change culture.
   - Spark change in others.
   - Lead by example (be the CAMS model!)
   - Be patient
 * Experiment
   - Low-cost
   - Low-risk
   - Goal == Kaizen
 * Decouple, Decouple, Decouple!
   - UI from Database.
   - Frontend from Back-office.
   - Custom features from vendor software.
 * Expect set-backs as well as successes.
 * Guide your team on a nature hike rather than drag them through a forest.
