# Aligning Business, Engineering and Operations with Actionable Metrics
**Author:** Dawn Parzych

## Why do we Gather Metrics?
 * To meet and keep goals.

## Metric can be dangerous
 * If metrics are measuring the wrong thing, that leads to invalid results.
 * If team and division metrics mis-align with corporate objectives, Bad Things Happen^TM.
 * "Managers who don't know how to measure what they want, settle for wanting what they can measure."  --Russel Ackoff
   - These are called Proxy measures.
   - Lead to Vanity metrics.
   - Vanity metric: a metric that makes you "feel good", but doesn't tell you anything.
     + Example: Tracking daily active users instead of "song plays".

## Metrics have consequences
 * What happens if a metric isn't met?
   - Root cause and fix?
   - Move the goal post?
   - Withhold bonuses?
   - Fire people?
   - Businesses go under?
 * Black swans (Outliers):
   - Examine the outliers and find out why it was an outlier.

## Metrics tell a story
 * Tell a story using the metrics and get buy-in from people.
 * Cognitive bias:
   - We do it because thinking is hard:
     1. Too much information.
     2. Not enough meaning.
     3. Not enough time.
     4. Not enough memory.
   - Two ways of thinking
     - Mode 1: Automatic responses.
     - Mode 2: Systematic response.
   - Can manifest itself in metrics as "biased metrics": metrics that exist to support an assumed conclusion and truth.

## Making metrics actionable
 * Action expresses priorities.
 * Metrics need to be actionable to priorities and values.
 * Metrics need to be:
   1. Actionable.
   2. Simple.
   3. Comparable.
   4. Honest and Relevant.
     * AKA: cannot be "gamed" or "spun".
     * Are these metrics being used to meet a goal?
 * Metrics should _not_:
   1. Be used to show that one team is better than another.
   2. Be used as a mere target.
 * Visualize Data
 * Avoid Summary stats (unless presenting data visualizations)
 * Metrics should only matter if they matter to the organization.
