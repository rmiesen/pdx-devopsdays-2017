# You Canâ€™t Always Get What You Want (Or Can You?)
**Author:** Kristen Gallagher.

 * You want to make the best thing, right?
   - What's standing between you and achieving that goal?

## How to help you help yourself by helping other teams
 * What's the real communication challenge your teams are facing?
   - Not understanding each other's goals, needs.
   - Cross-cultural issues.
   - Timezone issues.
 * What are the business goals for these teams---and how are they different from yours?
   - Sales
   - Support
   - Product Management
   - Human Resources
   - Finance
 * How are you currently communicating to these teams and what's not working?
 * Solutions:
   1. First, understand the business needs of the other team---not just your own.
   2. Refocus the conversation.
     * Move from adversarial to advocating.
     * See it as "we" not "us vs. them".
     * Try "yes, and..."
     * Include your understanding of their business needs.
   3. Use tooling to open up black boxes between other teams.
     - Examples:
       + Jira/Ticketing: create a workflow & checkpoints.
       + GitHub: Teach a basic GitHub workshop & work together to create handbooks, etc.
       + Confluence: Improve your space's IA so it has more context.
   4. Onboard non-technical team peers into your team just like you'd onboard a new hire to your team.
   5. Reflect and get feedback. What worked for those teams? What didn't. Repeat!
 * What do you do that is integral to your work, but also connects to other team's work?
   - Start by writing that list, then build out lightweight, jargon-free documentation to help them get their answers early on.
