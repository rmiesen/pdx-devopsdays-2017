 * Much like cars were initially built by-hand and now almost fully automatically, infrastructure is now increasingly fully automated.
 * Mutable
   - Deploy
   - Configure
   - Reconfigure
 * Immutable:
   - Deploy
   - Configure
   - Replace
 * Some Immutability concerns:
   - Orchestration
   - Network
   - Storage
   - Operating system
 * Possible Solution: Project Atomic
   - Works using "OS trees".
   - Basically "git for OSes".
