# Reproducible Infrastructure with Terraform and Puppet

 * Terraform: used to define infrastructure resource in code and ensure they exist and are in the declared state
 * Puppet / Chef / Ansible: Used to get an OS into a desired configuration state.
 * Terraform vs. puppetlabs-aws
   - Puppet's good at maintaining infrastructure at a certain state.
   - Terraform is good at managing infrastructure that is frequently changing, rebuilding infrastructure.
