# Notes for the PDX DevOpsDays 2017 Conference
**Note Taker:** Robert Miesen

## Overview

This repo contains a collection of notes taken on the presentations and open sessions that the note taker attended at the PDX DevOpsDays and the Configuration Management Camp + Container Days 2017 conferences. These two conferences were held August 1st through August 3rd 2017.

These notes are organized by the conference day they were taken on and are numbered in the order in which the presentation was given. For open spaces, only the open space that I was most interested in was the one I took notes on.

## FAQ
### Why aren't there any notes for a given presentation / Why are there gaps in the presentation numberings?
This could be for a number of reasons. These reason include, but are not limited to:
 1. I didn't feel the presentation had any information worth cpaturing. This is particularly the case of the "Career Story" type of presentations.
 2. I couldn't follow along the presentation well enough to make intelligable notes out of them.
 3. I skipped out on that presentation due to the mental drain attending a multi-day conference can have on a person. This was especially the case for Day 3, where there were no notes for the last three presentations due to how tired I was and how hot it was (it was over 100&#8457; that day).

### Why are there comments about Techology Y when only Technology X are Covered in the Presentation?
Because, TIMTOWTDI (There Is More Than One Way To Do It). :simple_smile: That, and these are the alternative technologies I personally use and I feel it useful to mention those technologies as relevant.


## A Topical Guide to the Conference notes:
To help readers quickly find topics that are of most interst to themselves, the notes have been grouped into the topical categories they cover. Note: a presentation may appear in more than one category.
