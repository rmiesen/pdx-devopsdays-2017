# Notes for the PDX DevOpsDays 2017 Conference
**Note Taker:** Robert Miesen

**PDX DevOpsDays Website:** <https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2017-portland/>

## Overview

This repo contains a collection of notes taken on the presentations and open sessions that the note taker attended at the PDX DevOpsDays and the Configuration Management Camp + Container Days 2017 conferences. These two conferences were held August 1st through August 3rd 2017.

These notes are organized by the conference day they were taken on and are numbered in the order in which the presentation was given. For open spaces, only the open space that I was most interested in was the one I took notes on.

## FAQ
### Why aren't there any notes for a given presentation / Why are there gaps in the presentation numberings?
This could be for a number of reasons. These reason include, but are not limited to:
 1. I didn't feel the presentation had any information worth capturing. This is particularly the case of the "Career Story" type of presentations.
 2. I couldn't follow along the presentation well enough to make intelligible notes out of them.
 3. I skipped out on that presentation due to the mental drain attending a multi-day conference can have on a person. This was especially the case for Day 3, where there were no notes for the last three presentations due to how tired I was and how hot it was (it was over 100&#8457; that day).

### Why are there comments about Technology Y when only Technology X are Covered in the Presentation?
Because, TIMTOWTDI (There Is More Than One Way To Do It). :smiley: That, and these are the alternative technologies I personally use and I feel it useful to mention those technologies as relevant.


## Summaries of all presentations
Below are summaries for all the presentations, ignite sessions, and open sessions that the note taker attended. They are ordered by the day and time in which the presentations took place. (And yes, the headers _are_ a "Majora's Mask" reference :smiley:)

### The First Day
 1. [QAELK: Are our tests any good?](./Day1/02-QAELK-are_our_test_any_good.md)
   - QAELK is a custom tool that leverages [Elastic](http://www.elastic.co) to aggregate and visualize test metadata. This metadata is then used to identify flaky tests, useless tests, and tests that are too costly to run all the time. The tool authors are planning to overhaul the tech stack with Google BigQuery and an in-house tool they call "Dr. Teeth"
